# MineSweeperGame
## Overview
#### This is a custom reproduction of the classic Minesweeper game, made to grow my JavaScript skills. This project will use JavaScript primarily, with HTML and CSS to render the interface.

## User Stories
#### As a user I want the ability to...
#### - Start a game with all of the tiles on the board hidden
#### - Click on a tile and have it revealed
#### - Have all other adjacent tiles with no adjacent mines revealed
#### - Reveal all tiles on the edge of the revealed area
#### - Reveal no additional tiles if the clicked tile is adjacent to a mine
#### - Tiles adjacent to at least one mine should be displayed with a number indicating how many mines are in the surrounding 8 tiles
#### - Make further selections until either:
#### - A mine is clicked on or
#### - All tiles without mines are revealed
#### - The game ends with either a win or loss
#### - Able to play again
